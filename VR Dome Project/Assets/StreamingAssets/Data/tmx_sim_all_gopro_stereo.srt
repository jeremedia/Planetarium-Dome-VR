00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:12,181
Welcome to the SHIELD Simularium - a cutting-edge, Virtual Reality environment.

2
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:15,938
(bowing in greeting) I am Iron Fist - Namaste.

3
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:18,377
Activating simulation.

4
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:25,320
Today’s replicated environment is modeled after my dojo in the mystic city of K’un-Lun.

5
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:34,343
There I defeated the dragon known as Shou-Lao the Undying, attaining the power of the IRON FIST.

6
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:44,749
Welcome, newbies and wanna-bees! Remember me? I’m Jennifer Walters but most people call me...

7
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:48,530
...She-Hulk. Congrats on making it this far!

8
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:55,210
Before we begin our training, we will demonstrate the full scope of our abilities. Like agility…

9
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,288
...And speed.

10
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:00,124
Don’t forget about strength...

11
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:06,624
Instructors! There’s a critical new development to report.

12
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:09,350
Going to full virtual mode - now.

13
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,138
The ROBS are transmitting live.

14
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:16,489
Our mission is paying off. A
fragment recovered from the Super

15
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:19,748
Adaptoid revealed the coordinates
of a secret HYDRA stronghold.

16
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:26,075
I’ve dispatched a small team to investigate. Meet Black Panther, one of our top trackers

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,878
The team’s in position.

18
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:34,995
We’ve confirmed that Red Skull and Madame Hydra are inside

19
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:39,628
Cloak that ROB before we’re made.

20
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:41,230
Just letting you know we’re here.

21
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:44,581
All clear. Where’s Wolverine?

22
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:48,386
Wake up Widow! This isn’t a training mission.

23
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:51,737
(sniffing) Panther’s back...

24
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:57,386
Perimeter guards neutralized. Has Vision finished scouting inside?

25
00:01:57,682 --> 00:02:00,791
(with SWAT precision) He should be back in 3, 2...

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,336
There are five sentry
Adaptoids in the adjacent

27
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:07,752
corridor. They should not be a problem.
Follow me.

28
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:11,853
(exasperated) ...Or not This way.

29
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:14,518
Watch out. You’ve got company.

30
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:17,900
Everyone duck!

31
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:20,820
Nice toss

32
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,398
What’s our play?

33
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:23,906
Fall in

34
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:26,116
That’s not what that means

35
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:39,467
(whispering) The entire Adaptoid army appears to be offline

36
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,466
(stopping Cap) Well then don’t wake ‘em up

37
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:43,817
Vision, what’s your status?

38
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,020
(pointing) Trapped - in an energy field...

39
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:47,293
Get him outta there!

40
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:51,433
(disgusted) Ah, MODOK! Filthy beast!

41
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,144
Look there - in the shadows - Madame Hydra

42
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,018
- And Red Skull

43
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:58,736
Three of SHIELD’s most-wanted!

44
00:02:58,799 --> 00:02:59,408
Move in!

45
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:04,361
(re Vision) This intruder’s presence tells us that SHIELD is close on our heels

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,891
This trap won’t hold him for long

47
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:14,071
We don’t need much time now. We’ll have them under our heels as soon as MY army is deployed

48
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:17,727
OUR army will be fully operational within the hour

49
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:20,085
Then we’ll eat SHIELD like a giant cupcake

50
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:21,702
It’s over, Red Skull

51
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:24,724
(turning, unconcerned) Only for the reign of Heroes

52
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,498
(pleasantly surprised) Oh? Captain America!

53
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:29,810
(growling) You are surrounded

54
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:34,928
Poor thing. Even your senses have deceived you this time

55
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:36,442
Come to MODOK!

56
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:39,192
What the -?

57
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:40,245
Holograms?!

58
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,417
(shouting right into lens) They’re coming for you! Get out!

59
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:51,690
Sorry to interrupt the broadcast but MODOK’s here. I see every one of you.

60
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,275
Jocasta! Your force-field!

61
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:57,135
Activating. Remain calm

62
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,672
Remain calm

63
00:03:58,758 --> 00:04:00,547
You are completely safe

64
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:02,289
Oh yes, It’s very safe

65
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:06,421
All recruits - proceed through the exit to the transport corridor

66
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:13,054
Oh the corridor. Yes that’s very safe, says the mobile organism designed for killing!!

67
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:19,000
I’m going to kill you. That’s what I do.
