# Planetarium-Dome-VR
 DIGITAL SKY-DOME-THEATRE

##Innovative Technology
“Solutions on the cutting edge of technology that have already made yesterday’s impossibilities the commonplace realities of today.”

##Project's Title
VIRTUAL DOME - A DOME PLANETERIUM EXPERIENCE in VR

##Project Description
Product Idea - A VR technology-based 360° Sky dome experience. 

##Product Solution
The VR technology allows immersive simulation as an experience using 3D 6 DOF. The entire planetarium experience of sky dome theater will be recreated “digitally” as a 3D Virtual Set and the existing 360 video content dome experience be simulated using the virtual reality headsets.

##Product Problem Statement
The Existing Sky theater (Dome) Planetarium Experience requires a huge investment, space allotment and is an entirely physically installed, infrastructure dependent and manually operated controlled system and is highly expensive.

Further, it requires a skilled/training human-workforce, electricity-dependent (power consumption), expensive rented machinery infrastructure costs overhead, requires complex installations, non-flexible, non-portable, non-automated and immobile system and requires lots of regular manual operations and maintenance costs and human efforts.

The current system also is not very cost-effective and has limited ticketing shows and requires full capacity scheduled shows to function. Sometimes, one odd ticket sold shows are even canceled.

##Project Use-case (AIM)
The Project is developed to educate childrens on subjects like astronomy. The digital simulation content and experience is designed for Education, Training and Astronomical fields to study and learn, designed specially for childrens.

Further, once the solution is designed, developed and tested it can be easily deployed as a “one-time procedure” using a simple detailed informative pdf manual that can be followed step by step by an operator.

The Software once developed will be deployed on as many VR devices as required. The digital software solution will eliminate the need of physical setups of sky-domes and be an absolutely portable, scalable and re-deployable cost-saving solution for the masses.

##Project Purpose
The current sky theater dome experience in planetariums installed worldwide does brings a great experience and temporarily solves the content delivery problems using physical screens and multiple projectors, but it doesnt have sustaintablity and scale factors for the product and further is not extremely cost effective and does bring other complications, which we can solve further using the complete digitization of the system as a software via the virtual reality technology.


##Product Scope and Approach
The Software will be an entire digital re-creation of the existing sky dome theatres as a virtual set. These virtual sets will be designed in 3D with real space like sitting, screens, lighting and other environmental factors to give the same look and feel of being inside a dome stadium.

The User will have accessibility of being inside these 3D Environment and a 360 Field of View and as a 6 DOF Movement using the virtual reality headsets.

The 360 Dome videos content will be played inside these digital sets in the software using the VR medium. The users will be able to see, rotate, listen and interact with the content in the software throughout the experience.


##Product Improvements
Additionally, improvements to our software solution can also bring creativity and other elements of the experience for instance: 
1. 360 3D Binaural Audio for complete immersive experience.
2. Interactable Designed Menu for all education Video Content as a list.
3. Virtual Gallery (Users can do physical walkthrough)
4. Educational Games on astronomy, physics and science.
5. 2D Educational video content on a 2D movie theater sets.
